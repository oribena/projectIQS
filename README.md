The Iterative Query Selection (IQS) Web Platform retrieves information from opaque search engines using the IQS algorithm.
Given a document, the algorithm extracts the optimal short keyword queries thus improving the retrieval quality from opaque search engines.

## Web Platform Overveiw

* Search and retrieve data from Twitter's website using the IQS algorithm.
* Performs comparison experiment between the IQS algorithm and other state of the art algorithm (ALMIK).
* Review past search results on their history page.
* Designed for a wide range of users.

# IQS Python Package

The python packege implements the IQS algorithm 

## Installation

Installation can be done using [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/IQS-algorithm/):

```bash
pip install IQS-algorithm
```
In order to use the package add `from IQS_algorithm import IQS` to your code.

## Python Package Overveiw

* Performs the IQS algorithm on various queries by providing a simple API for accessing all its functionality.
* Modify the quality of the search results from Twitter by setting different parameters. 
* Designed for users with technical background.
* Download the package using pip install IQS-algorithm
